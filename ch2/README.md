The second test consists in making a jquery plugin to deal with masked inputs, as shown in `creditcard.gif`.

Requirements:

- Use sass, with scss flavor, to build the styles.
- jquery is the only library allowed to use in this exercise.
- Only numbers are allowed to input.
- The cursor is handled by the plugin. The user would not have to press tab key to keep filling the number.
- Take in mind a user could paste a complete number. In this scenario, the plugin should be intelligent enough to fill the inputs properly.

What do you need to deliver:
  - a zip file including all the html, compiled css and scss files do you need to complete the challenge. The html should be ready to work when opened in a browser.
